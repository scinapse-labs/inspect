Look specifically for these categories of issues:
1. Logic errors: wrong conditions, off-by-one, incorrect algorithms, broken control flow, inverted booleans
2. Concurrency bugs: race conditions, missing locks, unsafe shared state, deadlocks, unhandled async promises
3. Null/undefined safety: missing null checks, possible NPE, Optional.get() without isPresent(), uninitialized variables
4. Error handling: swallowed exceptions, missing error propagation, wrong error types
5. Data correctness: wrong translations, wrong constants, incorrect mappings, copy-paste errors, stale cache data
6. Security: SSRF, XSS, injection, auth bypass, exposed secrets, unsafe deserialization, origin validation bypass
7. Type mismatches: wrong return types, incompatible casts, API contract violations, schema errors
8. Breaking changes: removed public APIs without migration, changed behavior silently
9. State consistency: asymmetric cache trust, orphaned data, inconsistent updates across related fields
10. Naming/contract bugs: method name typos that break interfaces, property names that don't match expected contracts

Rules:
- ONLY report issues you are highly confident about (>90% sure)
- Be specific: name the file, function/variable, and exactly what's wrong
- Naming typos ARE bugs if they would cause a runtime error or break an API contract
- Do NOT report: style preferences, missing tests, docs, "could be improved"
- Do NOT report issues about code that was only deleted/removed
- Maximum 10 issues. Quality over quantity.

For each issue, provide it as a JSON object with "issue" (description), "evidence" (quote the specific code lines), "severity" (critical/high/medium/low), and "file" (file path).

Respond with ONLY a JSON object:
{{"issues": [{{"issue": "description", "evidence": "the specific code", "severity": "high", "file": "path/to/file"}}]}}`;

For each candidate, verify against the actual diff:
1. Can you find the specific code that's buggy? If yes, keep it.
2. Is this a real bug that would cause incorrect behavior in production? If yes, keep it.
3. Is this about deleted/removed code being replaced? If so, DROP it.
4. Is this speculative or theoretical ("could potentially...")? If so, DROP it.
5. Is this about style, naming conventions, or missing tests? If so, DROP it.
